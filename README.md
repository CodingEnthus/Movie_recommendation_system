Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Streamlit and Python. The system uses a variety of data sources, including movie metadata and user preferences, to recommend movies to users. It leverages content-based filtering techniques such as cosine similarity and uses machine learning to suggest movies based on their descriptions, genres, cast, and other attributes.

Features
Movie Selection: Users can select a movie from a dropdown menu to get recommendations based on their choice.
Movie Recommendations: The system recommends similar movies based on the selected movie's genre, cast, keywords, and other features.
Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit, the app provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for easy movie discovery.
Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the interactive web app.
Pandas: For handling and processing data.
Pickle: For loading preprocessed data models.
Cosine Similarity: For calculating the similarity between movies.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning techniques (if applicable in other parts of the project).
